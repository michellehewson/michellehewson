Hi! My name is Michelle Hewson, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics from Western Carolina University and I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Data Science at Harvard University. I currently work as an Operations Research Analyst for the Air Force Special Operations Command, and I am interested in leveraging mathematical analysis to empower data-driven decision-making.
